# TinyCryptLib

A **modular, lightweight C crypto library** including SHA variants, HMAC, KMAC, and Keccak.  
Designed with **layered APIs** similar to OpenSSL, but smaller scale, where each API layer has its own prefix.

---

## Project Goals / TODO

### 1. Hashing
Hash functions provide integrity and form the basis for MACs, KDFs, and RNGs.

- [x] **SHA-1** – legacy hash, good for learning, not recommended for new designs.
- [x] **SHA-224 / SHA-256 / SHA-512** – widely used, secure SHA-2 family.
- [x] **SHA3-224 / SHA3-256 / SHA3-512** – sponge-based design, resistant to length-extension attacks.
- [x] **SHAKE / rawSHAKE** – extendable-output functions (XOF), flexible output length.
- [ ] **cSHAKE** – customizable SHAKE variant for keyed or domain-specific hashing.

**Notes:** 
- Hashes are required for HMACs, KMACs, and some DRBG constructions.  
- **cSHAKE implementation is experimental:** it attempts to follow SP800-185 closely, including explicit handling of N/S customization strings. Some libraries simplify or absorb customization differently, so outputs may not match other implementations exactly. Users should verify against their own test vectors.

---

### 2. HMAC / KMAC
Message Authentication Codes ensure **data integrity and authenticity**.

- [x] **HMAC-SHA1** – simple MAC using SHA-1 (legacy).
- [x] **HMAC-SHA2** – widely used, secure.
- [x] **HMAC-SHA3** – newer design, resistant to length-extension attacks.
- [ ] **KMAC** – keyed SHA-3 based MAC, supports variable-length keys and output.

**Notes:** MACs are building blocks for authenticated encryption and secure RNGs.

---

### 3. Pre-Cipher Utilities
Utilities for encoding and decoding data to facilitate testing and real-world usage.

- [ ] **Hex encode/decode** – common format for test vectors.
- [ ] **Base64 encode/decode** – widely used in networking and data transfer.
- [ ] **Base32 encode/decode** – optional, used in protocols like TOTP.

**Notes:** Implement these before ciphers to simplify testing with RFC/NIST vectors.

---

### 4. Symmetric Ciphers
Provide **confidentiality** via block and stream ciphers.

- [ ] **AES (CBC / CTR / GCM / XTS)** – block cipher with multiple modes.
- [ ] **ChaCha20 (+ Poly1305)** – stream cipher, software-friendly, AEAD support with Poly1305.

**Notes:** Start with simple modes (CBC/CTR), then implement authenticated encryption (GCM/Poly1305).

---

### 5. RNG / DRBG
Random number generation for keys, nonces, and salts.

- [ ] **Fast PRNG (Xorshift128+, PCG)** – software-efficient, non-crypto use.
- [ ] **SHA-based DRBG** – cryptographically secure deterministic RNG.
- [ ] **Seed from user/system entropy** – ensure unpredictable input.

**Notes:** RNGs feed salts, nonces, and cryptographic keys. Secure seeding is critical.

---

### 6. Salts / Nonces
Stretch and derive keys securely. Turn passwords or shared secrets into cryptographically strong keys.

- [ ] **Salt generator (RNG)** – for hashing, KDFs, and MACs.
- [ ] **Nonce generator (RNG)** – for ciphers like AES-GCM or ChaCha20.

---

### 7. Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)
Stretch and derive keys securely.

- [ ] **scrypt** – memory-hard KDF designed to derive strong keys from low-entropy inputs
- [ ] **PBKDF2** – password-based key derivation using iterative hashing.
- [ ] **HKDF** – modern extract+expand key derivation using HMAC.

---

### 8. Padding Utilities
Required for block ciphers to handle plaintext not aligned to block size.

- [ ] **PKCS#7 padding** – standard padding scheme.
- [ ] **Zero padding** – simple, less recommended for variable-length messages.

---

### 9. Optional / Future Enhancements
- Additional AES modes (CFB, OFB, CCM) and ChaCha variants.
- TRNGs (jitter, thermal noise, hardware-based) for high-quality entropy.
- Unit tests using RFC/NIST test vectors.
- Integrated authenticated encryption pipelines combining MACs and ciphers.

## Layered API Design

1. **Low-level:** raw hash/HMAC/KMAC implementations → internal use  
2. **EVP layer:** dispatcher by enum/macro, supports streaming/piping and user-facing APIs
